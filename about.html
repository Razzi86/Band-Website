                <p> Mt. Joy is an American indie rock band formed in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 2015.
                    The band is composed of Matt Quinn (vocals, guitar), Sam Cooper (guitar, vocals), 
                    Jackie Miclau (bass), Sotiris Eliopoulos (drums), and Michael Byrnes (guitar, vocals). 
                    The band's name is derived from a mountain in Valley Forge National Historical Park.
